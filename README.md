# PCO Webhook

Planning Center Online doesn’t notify you when a service you are scheduled for is updated. That’s a problem! This simple webhook allows you to receive an IFTTT push notification whenever an event you subscribe to is triggered. You will need to set up a webhook on [planning center's api website](http://api.planningcenteronline.com). Set the appropriate events, set the URL to wherever you are running this app (the URL), and pass the appropriate params. You'll need to set up a PusH Notification on Webhook hook in IFTTT. Then enjoy being notified on PCO service updates!
